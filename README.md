# Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography

## Project Overview
This project focuses on securely concealing sensitive information within an image using steganography. Unlike traditional encryption methods that may make hidden data more detectable, steganography embeds information within image pixels while preserving visual integrity.

## Problem Statement
Data security is a growing concern in today's digital world. Standard encryption techniques make hidden messages more noticeable. Steganography offers a way to hide messages within images seamlessly, ensuring privacy and protection against unauthorized access.

## Technologies Used
### Libraries
- OpenCV – Image processing and manipulation
- NumPy – Handling and manipulating image arrays
- PIL (Pillow) – Image handling and operations
- Cryptography – Encrypting and securing hidden messages

## Wow Factors
- Dual-Layer Security – Combines encryption with steganography for enhanced protection.
- Historical Significance – Used in wartime intelligence and digital forensics.
- Modern Applications – Helps in copyright protection, secure communication, and digital investigations.
- Invisibility – Messages are hidden without altering the visual quality of images.
- Open Source Power – Built using OpenCV, making it accessible and powerful.

## End Users
- Cybersecurity Professionals – Secure data transmission and covert communication.
- Forensic Experts – Extract hidden information for digital investigations.
- Government & Defense Agencies – Securely embed classified data in images.
- Researchers & Academics – Study and improve steganographic techniques.
- Privacy-Conscious Users – Protect personal or confidential data.

## Results & Conclusion
This project successfully embeds and retrieves hidden messages within images without compromising their quality. It ensures secure data transmission while being resistant to detection methods used against traditional encryption.

## Future Scope
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) – To simplify message embedding and extraction.
- Drag and Drop Support – Allow users to select images and messages easily.
- Customization Options – Adjustable encoding methods and bit depth selection.
- Real-time Preview – Show image changes before and after steganography is applied.
